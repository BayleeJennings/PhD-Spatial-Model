# PhD-Spatial-Model
This web map is designed to directly support the thesis submitted by Baylee Jennings to The University of Staffordshire, June, 2025. 
The following data is indicative and all site values are measured as an approximation.

There are two options for viewability included in the web map version of the results that can be toggled on or off. These are the basemaps to contextualise the overlayed layers that contain the data for each site modelled in the research. The web map contains an initial layer showing the habitats within the modelled green spaces and immediate surrounding area (SoT and NuL UKCEH Habs). The following layer describes the approximate site values (Modelled Site Values) for each green space that were used in the spatial models, informing the likelihood and subsequent predicted values for (Predicted Species Richness, Predicted Abundance, and Predicted Simpsons Repcricol). These layers can be toggled on or off using the layer panel in the top right hand corner of the interface. The final layer (Surveyed Sites PhD) indicates the true data for the sites that were surveyed during the research phase, and is overlayed at the top.
